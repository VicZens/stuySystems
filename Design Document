Bugs:
	-Cannot change to a 2nd different directory.
	ex. cd <dir1> and then cd <dir2>, which is in dir1, will not work.
	-Inserting unnecessary spaces will not work.
	-When using ; or > or <, leaving spaces in between the arguments will 
	cause an error
	ex. ls ; echo hello will cause an error while ls;echo hello will run fine
