by Victor Wu

Features:

	-Can exit and cd!

Attempted:
	

Bugs:
	-If you cd .. and then try to cd into something else, it doesn't work and
	will fork the function.
	-Inserting unnecessary spaces will not work.
	-Cannot use two ; in one line
	-When using ;, leaving spaces in between the arguments will cause an error
	ex. ls ; ps will cause an error while ls;ps will run fine
	-Don't kill yourself. Just exit.
